Hi there! I am Muhammed Ashfaq.

I have a keen interest in the field of Software Development.

At the moment, I am actively engaged in various projects that involve React, Redux, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS.

I am actively seeking internships and entry-level positions to both apply my existing skills and gain further knowledge and experience in this field.
